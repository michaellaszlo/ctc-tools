# CTC tools

## Tools for extracting and analyzing data from c2ctc.com

This package contains web-scraping and number-crunching scripts that
extract information from the [CTC website](http://c2ctc.com/), which is
a competitive league formed by teams of indoor rowers. Indoor rowing
is also known as erging, after the machine&mdash;the Concept 2 rowing
ergometer&mdash;that is used in this sport.

Two visualizations are offered:
- `tally.html`: a monthly ranking of teams by number of boats floated
- `scoring.html`: a proposed method of choosing the team that gets to set the challenge each month
