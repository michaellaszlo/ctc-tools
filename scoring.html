<h1> CTC participation leaderboard </h1>

<h2> Ranking formula: logarithmic accumulation and slow decay </h2>

<p> Each team carries a running total from month to month. This
total is adjusted according to the number of boats the team has
floated in the current month. </p>

<p> Let <span class="math">x</span> be the number of boats floated
by a team. Then: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is greater than zero, the
  team gains <span class="math">floor(100*log(x+1))</span> points. <i>[make an info box for the formula]</i>
  </li>
  <li>  &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is zero, the
  team loses 10% of its total from the previous month.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Teams are ranked according to their running total. <i>[put the following in an info box]</i> If several teams are tied for first place, the tie is broken as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; A team that has never chosen a challenge is preferred. </li>
  <li> &bull; Failing that, a team that chose its last challenge longer ago is preferred. </p>
  <li> &bull; If there is still a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. </li>
</ul>

<p> The team in first place wins the right to select the next
challenge, and its running total is reset to zero. </p>
