<h1> CTC participation leaderboard simulation </h1>

<h2> Proposed ranking formula </h2>

<p> Each team carries a total number of points from month to month.
This total is adjusted according to the number of boats the team
has floated in the current month. </p>

<p> Let <span class="math">x</span> be the number of boats floated
by a team. Then: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is greater than zero, the
  team gains <span class="math">floor(100&middot;log(x+1))</span> points. <span class="question">&oplus; What does this formula mean?</span>
  </li>
  <li>  &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is zero, the
  team loses 20% of its total.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Teams are ranked according to their total. <span class="question">&oplus; How
are ties broken?</span> </p>

<p> <i>info box:</i> Due to the precision of the scoring formula,
ties for first place occur rarely. There are no first-place ties
when the formula is applied to the past three years of CTC results.
Ties at lower ranks have no effect on deciding the winner. All ties
are broken according to the following rules: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; A team that has never chosen a challenge is preferred. </li>
  <li> &bull; Otherwise, a team that chose its last challenge longer ago is preferred. </p>
  <li> &bull; If there is still a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. </li>
</ul>

<p> The team in first place wins the right to select the next
challenge, and its total is reset to zero. </p>
