<h1> CTC participation leaderboard </h1>


<h2> Proposed ranking method </h2>

<p> Each team carries a total number of points from month to month.
This total is adjusted according to the number of boats the team
has floated in the current month. </p>

<p> Let <span class="math">x</span> be the number of boats floated
by a team. Then: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is greater than zero, the
  team gains <span class="math">floor(100&middot;log(x+1))</span> points. <span class="question">&diams; What does the formula mean?</span>
  </li>
  <li>  &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is zero, the
  team loses 20% of its total.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Teams are ranked according to their total. <span class="question">&diams; How
are ties broken?</span> </p>

<div class="answer"> <p> Ties for first place are broken according
to the following rules: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; A team that has never chosen a challenge is preferred. </li>
  <li> &bull; Otherwise, a team that chose its last challenge longer ago is preferred. </p>
  <li> &bull; If there is still a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. </li>
</ul>

<p> Note: Due to the precision of the scoring formula, ties for
first place occur infrequently. For the past nine years of CTC data,
there are no such ties with this formula. </p>

</div>

<p> The team in first place wins the right to select the next
challenge, and its total is reset to zero. </p>
