<h1> CTC participation leaderboard </h1>


<h2> Proposed ranking method </h2>

<p> Each team carries a total number of points from month to month.
This total is adjusted according to the number of boats the team
has floated in the current month. </p>

<p> Let <span class="math">x</span> be the number of boats floated
by a team. Then: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is greater than zero, the
    team gains <span
    class="math">floor(100&middot;log<sub>2</sub>(x+1))</span>
    points.
    <span class="toggle">&#9654; What does this formula mean?</span>
  </li>

<div class="infoBox" id="functionChart">

<p> The scoring formula awards many points for the first few boats
floated by a team in one month. As a team floats more boats, the
number of points for each additional boat becomes progressively
smaller. This means that teams still have an incentive to float
more points, but large teams will not earn vastly more points than
small teams. </p>

<p> The following chart shows how many points are awarded for
floating a given number of boats. </p>

</div><!--end infoBox-->

  <li> 
    &bull; If <span class="math">x</span> is zero, the
    team loses 20% of its total.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Teams are ranked according to their total.
  <span class="toggle">&#9654; How are ties broken?</span> </p>

<div class="infoBox">

<p> Ties for first place should occur rarely. With this formula,
there are no ties for the past nine years of CTC data. </p>

<p> If there is a tie for first place, it is broken according to
the following rules: </p>

<ul>
  <li> &bull; A team that has never chosen a challenge is preferred. </li>
  <li> &bull; Otherwise, a team that chose its last challenge longer ago is preferred. </p>
  <li> &bull; If there is still a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. </li>
</ul>

</div><!--end infoBox-->

<p> The team in first place wins the right to select the next
challenge. At the start of the following month, its score is reset
to half the number of points it earned in the current month. </p>
