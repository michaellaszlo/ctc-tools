+ make both tables at once and swap them to switch orientation
+ calculate table width based on data
+ copy tally.js to scoring.js
+ compute monthly participation rankings
+ display the participation rankings
+ make a deterministic PRNG so that tie-breaking is consistent
+ introduce team IDs to simplify the deterministic pseudo-random ordering
+ revise the tie procedure: decide lower ranks by lexical order of team name
+ change the button to a vertical stack
+ display summary statistics: mean boats, mean months to win, charts
+ add a winner's rollover to the scoring formula: month's score divided by 2
+ make info boxes

necessary
- fill out the info box explaining the scoring formula
- check layout in all major browser/OS combinations

probable
- summary charts: show tick marks labeled with the year
- leaderboard: show rank numbers
- summary charts: highlight month and show data on hover
- leaderboard: illuminate column and/or row on hover

potential
- make the decay and rollover optional (toggle with checkboxes)
- experiment with other ranking formulae
- use getComputedStyle to synchronize JS with CSS
- do something about text on dark backgrounds
- add controls to enlarge chart
